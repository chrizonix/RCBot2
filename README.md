## RCBot2 for Windows and Linux (TF2, HL2:DM, DOD:S)

### Information
This is a fork of the official RCBot2 plugin written by Cheeseh, which can be found [here](http://rcbot.bots-united.com/). <br />
This repository is mainly used for the Linux release of his plugin, but it also works on Windows.

### Community
Cheeseh also got his own GitHub repository, which can be found here: https://github.com/rcbotCheeseh/rcbot2

### Installation
A complete guide for installing this plugin can be found at the official RCBot2 forums over [here](http://rcbot.bots-united.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1967). <br />
This thread is also maintained by me.

### Build
* Go to `linux_sdk`
* Type `make -f Makefile.rcbot2 vcpm`
* Type `make -f Makefile.rcbot2 genmf` (this will generate the Makefiles)
* Edit `Makefile.rcbot2` and `Makefile.HPB_bot2_*` according to your needs
  * Most of the time you will only need to modify Line 21 and 55 of `Makefile.rcbot2`
* Type `make -f Makefile.rcbot2 all -j4 2> error.log`
* Check the `error.log`

### Changelog
* Fixed a bug in getNextRoutePoint, which destroyed bot aiming, because of invalid vLook
* Fixed reading of files with windows line ending (\r\n)
* Fixed all offsets for Linux
* Added "master offset" settings for TF2
* Fixed a typo while reading bot configs (visionticksclients -> visionticks_clients)
* Fixed macro in bot_profile.cpp
* Fixed consecutive use of "addbot"
* Added debug messages in chat (rcbot debug chat 1)
* Added automatic bot quota, based on human players
* You can now edit the path of where you have installed RCBot by writing it in the rcbot2.vdf
  * (relative paths to the mod folder are also supported)
